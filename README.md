# Eques-Cassus
Eques Cassus: Hollow Knight in Latinum Conversum

## How to Install
To install, download the repository by first clicking the green button labeled `Code`, and then selecting `Download ZIP` in the dropdown menu. Extract the zip, and keep the `LA` folder, which contains the translation files.
Install the translation using the [LanguageSupport](https://github.com/SFGrenade/LanguageSupport) mod from the [Scarab](https://github.com/fifty-six/Scarab) mod manager. Exact instructions on how to use the LanguageSupport mod can be found [here](https://github.com/SFGrenade/LanguageSupport), but they amount to copying the `LA` folder into the `LanguageSupport` folder.

Once installed, select `Sermo Latinus` from the options in the main menu. Due to a limitation of the LanguageSupport mod, the custom language won't show on the language select screen when opening up the game.
